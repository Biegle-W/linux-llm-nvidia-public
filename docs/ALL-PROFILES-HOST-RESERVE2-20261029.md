# All six profiles: host-RAM reserve 2 GiB — October 29, 2026

The human approved a **2 GiB host-available RAM floor across all six maintained
profiles**. The registry now explicitly selects 2 GiB for each profile; the common
reader also defaults to 2 GiB. Both dense and MoE supervisors use the selected
value, and the benchmark monitor records and follows the same per-profile floor.
This supersedes earlier Qwen-only 2 GiB / other-profile 8 GiB instructions.

Forty-one CPU checks passed, including both dense engines at the 2 GiB boundary,
below-floor stops, the unchanged 512 MiB VRAM boundary, thermal and swap stops,
worker budgets, intentional shutdown ownership and benchmark metric parsing.
Supervisor three-reading hysteresis, 82 C, all native VRAM reserves, worker
RAM/swap budgets, active swap/pressure/telemetry guards, swappiness 60, concurrency
one and 600-second idle unload are unchanged. No GPU models or benchmarks were
rerun. Model/cache/context settings and historical benchmark values are unchanged.

Normal workers were inactive; the new floor is read at their next launch. No
router/DSH restart or job cancellation occurred. Router idle, DSH preserved,
no GPU reservation and no fallback restored. The earlier Qwen/Maya reduced-RAM
failures remain unresolved; this policy change does not qualify those setups.

After explicit human confirmation that the RAM DIMM is restored, verify Linux
capacity, restore appropriate full-RAM cache values and validate normal guarded
loading. Preserve the separately approved 2 GiB reserve unless the human changes
that direction, along with unrelated router/Desktop improvements and credentials.
No timer or MemAvailable trigger.
